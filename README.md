# R Contribution Working Group

The R Contribution Working Group is a collaboration between R Core, Forwards and other R community groups, aiming to encourage new contributors to R core (the code and documentation that gets distributed as base R), with a focus on diversity and inclusion. Anyone from the R community that supports our objectives is welcome to attend our [meetings](#meetings) and to [get involved](#get-involved) as they have time and interest.

If you are interested in contributing to R, please visit the [R Contribution Site](https://forwards.github.io/rcontribution/).

## Current Work

Following our [end-of-Year-1 meeting on 2021-07-23](https://github.com/forwards/rcontribution/blob/master/team_minutes/2021-07-23.md) we are now developing ideas and proposals for Year 2, that we will discuss and prioritise at the next meeting in September.

<!-- We are currently working on initiatives discussed at the [team meeting on 2020-09-08](https://github.com/forwards/rcontribution/blob/master/team_minutes/2020-09-08.md). See the issues on this repo for more detail. -->

## Meetings

We meet (on Google Meet) every 1-2 months, alternating between the fourth Friday of the month, 15:00 UTC and the fourth Tuesday of the month, 21:00 UTC (-1hr during Daylight Savings Time). 

Next planned meeting(s):
- No meeting in August.
- Friday September 24, 2021, 14:00-15:00 UTC ([find your local time](https://arewemeetingyet.com/UTC/2021-09-24/14:00/R%20Contribution%20Working%20Group)).

Meeting details will be posted on the [R-Devel Slack Group](https://forwards.github.io/rcontribution/slack), or you can email rowforwards@gmail.com to be added to/removed from the mailing list to receive meeting invitations.

## Get Involved

Besides attending meetings, we welcome R community members to contribute in the following ways:

1. **Join related discussion on the [R-devel Slack group](https://forwards.github.io/rcontribution/slack)**. The `#core-outreach` channel provides an informal space to discuss the work of the Working Group and related topics, such similar initiatives in other programming communities.
2. **Propose/discuss initiatives via [issues](https://github.com/forwards/rcontribution/issues)**. Occasionally, we will dedicate a few weeks to proposing and discussing initiatives to work on via issues on this repository, however comments on issues or new issues are welcome at any time. An idea will need support from the R Contribution Working Group to be taken forward; this works best if the proposer or another sponsor of the idea brings it to a Working Group meeting.
3. **Volunteer to work on initiatives**. This can be done at a Working Group meeting, by volunteering on the R-devel Slack or corresponding GitHub issue, or by contacting rowforwards@gmail.com.
