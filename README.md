# R Contribution Working Group

The R Contribution Working Group is a collaboration between R Core, Forwards and other R community groups aiming to encourage new contributors to R core (the code and documentation that gets distributed as base R), with a focus on diversity and inclusion.

If you are interested in contributing to R, please visit the [R Contribution Site](https://forwards.github.io/rcontribution/).

## Current Work

We are currently working on initiatives discussed at the [team meeting on 2020-09-08](https://github.com/forwards/rcontribution/blob/master/team_minutes/2020-09-08.md). See the issues on this repo for more detail.

## Next Meetings

We meet every 1-2 months, alternating between the second Friday of the month, 15:00 UTC and the second Tuesday of the month, 21:00 UTC.

Next planned meeting(s):

- Friday January 8, 2021, 15:00-16:00 UTC ([local time](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2021-01-08/15:00/On-ramps%20to%20R%20core)).

Email rowforwards@gmail.com to be added to/removed from invite list.

## Get Involved

We welcome anyone from the R community that supports our objectives and would like to contribute, to get involved.

1. **Outside observers**: may comment on ideas/proposals discussed in [issues](https://github.com/forwards/rcontribution/issues). They may also open issues, with the understanding that any idea needs a sponsor from the R Contribution Working Group and agreement at a group meeting to be taken forward. Outside observers may also join the [R-devel Slack group](https://forwards.github.io/rcontribution/slack), a general space for contributors to R core - discussion related to outreach takes place on the `#outreach` channel.
2. **R Contribution Working Group members**: have write access to this repo, so they can open issues and be allocated to work on particular issues. They can also join in the team chat on GitHub and attend working group meetings. To ask to join the working group, contact rowforwards@gmail.com, saying a little about yourself and stating your GitHub username.

(Note for Forwards members: invites to the R Contribution Working group meetings are sent to all Forwards sub-teams. Please ask to be added to the GitHub R Contribution Team to get write access to this repo.)
