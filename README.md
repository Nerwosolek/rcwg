# Initiatives Encouraging Contribution to R Core

This is the home for a collaboration between R Core, Forwards and other R community groups on encouraging new contributors to R core (the code and documentation that gets distributed as base R), with a focus on diversity and inclusion.

## Current Work

Following our [kick-off meeting on 2020-07-24](https://github.com/forwards/rcontribution/blob/master/team_minutes/2020-07-24.md) we are spending August developing ideas and proposals for initiatives, that we will discuss and prioritise at a meeting in September (TBA).

## Get Involved

We welcome anyone from the R community that supports our objectives and would like to contribute, to get involved. There are 3 levels of involvement:

1. **Outside observers** - may comment on ideas discussed in issues.
