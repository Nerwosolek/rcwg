# Initiatives Encouraging Contribution to R Core

This is the home for a collaboration between R Core, Forwards and other R community groups on encouraging new contributors to R core (the code and documentation that gets distributed as base R), with a focus on diversity and inclusion.

## Current Work

We are starting work on initiatives discussed at the [team meeting on 2020-09-08](https://github.com/forwards/rcontribution/blob/master/team_minutes/2020-09-08.md). See the issues on this repo for more detail.

## Next meetings

- Friday January 8, 2021, 15:00-16:00 UTC ([local time](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2021-01-08/15:00/On-ramps%20to%20R%20core)).

Email rowforwards@gmail.com to be added to/removed from invite list.

## Get Involved

We welcome anyone from the R community that supports our objectives and would like to contribute, to get involved. There are 3 levels of involvement:

1. **Outside observers**: may comment on ideas/proposals discussed in [issues](https://github.com/forwards/rcontribution/issues). They may also open issues, with the understanding that any idea needs a sponsor from the R Contribution Team/Forwards to be taken forward.
2. **R Contribution Team members** - have write access to this repo, so they can open issues and be allocated to work on particular issues. They can also join in the team chat on GitHub and attend team meetings. To ask to join the team contact rowforwards@gmail.com, saying a little about yourself and stating your GitHub username.
3. **Forwards members** - can join in with the full activities of Forwards as described in the [knowledgebase](https://github.com/forwards/knowledgebase). The knowledgebase explains how to join Forwards; existing members please ask to be added to the R Contribution Team on GitHub to get write access to this repo.
