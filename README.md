# Initiatives Encouraging Contribution to R Core

This is the home for a collaboration between R Core, Forwards and other R community groups on encouraging new contributors to R core (the code and documentation that gets distributed as base R), with a focus on diversity and inclusion.

## Current Work

Following our [kick-off meeting on 2020-07-24](https://github.com/forwards/rcontribution/blob/master/team_minutes/2020-07-24.md) we are spending August developing ideas and proposals for initiatives, that we will discuss and prioritise at a meeting on Tuesday September 8, 21:00-22:00 UTC ([Convert time](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2020-09-08/22:00/On-ramps%20to%20R%20core), [agenda](https://hackmd.io/GzIGWM4ZTdmM3B3q6C24RA), email rowforwards@gmail.com for invite).

## Get Involved

We welcome anyone from the R community that supports our objectives and would like to contribute, to get involved. There are 3 levels of involvement:

1. **Outside observers**: may comment on ideas/proposals discussed in [issues](https://github.com/forwards/rcontribution/issues). They may also open issues, with the understanding that any idea needs a sponsor from the R Contribution Team/Forwards to be taken forward.
2. **R Contribution Team members** - have write access to this repo, so they can open issues and be allocated to work on particular issues. They can also join in the team chat on GitHub and attend team meetings. To ask to join the team contact rowforwards@gmail.com, saying a little about yourself and stating your GitHub username.
3. **Forwards members** - can join in with the full activities of Forwards as described in the [knowledgebase](https://github.com/forwards/knowledgebase). The knowledgebase explains how to join Forwards; existing members please ask to be added to the R Contribution Team on GitHub to get write access to this repo.

Everyone participating in this project agrees to follow the [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/forwards/rcontribution/blob/master/CONDUCT.md).

## Proposal Process

R Contribution Team/Forwards members can add any idea to [ideas_for_initiatives.md](https://github.com/forwards/rcontribution/blob/master/ideas_for_initiatives.md) in a relevant section. However, this is just a place to put ideas so we don't forget them. To take things forward, we will use a more formal proposal process, that will allow us to discuss each idea and fill out the detail.

### Sponsor an Idea

R Contribution Team/Forwards members can sponsor an idea. This means they (or their delegate) will put it forward at the September meeting. The meeting will then decide to 

1. Adopt idea as a current task for the R Contribution Team and start work/determine next steps.
2. Postpone decision till next meeting allowing for further discussion on GitHub/more volunteers to be found/relevant information to be gathered.
3. Reject idea for the short-term.

In order to sponsor an idea, it must first be proposed on GitHub, at least a week before the meeting.

### Propose an Idea on GitHub

Each participant can propose up to two ideas: one related to a short-term goal (that may be at least partially implemented by the end of 2020) and one related to a long-term goal (that we can do some preparatory work towards by the end of 2020).

1. Open an issue to propose your idea. If you are a R Contribution Team/Forwards member, this makes you the sponsor of the idea.
2. Label it as <kbd>short term goal</kbd> or <kbd>long term goal</kbd>.
3. If you are not a R Contribution Team/Forwards member, label it as <kbd>needs sponsor</kbd>.

### Discuss Ideas on GitHub

All participants are encouraged to discuss the ideas proposed in GitHub issues. 

Use comments to:
 - Give suggestions for refinements/implementation details.
 - Offer to sponsor an idea that needs a sponsor (then remove the <kbd>needs sponsor</kbd> label).
 - Offer to contribute to implementing the idea; if possible, specify what role(s) you could play.
 
Use emoji to:
 - Show your support for the idea.
 - Agree with other people's comments.
 
Assign yourself to the issue if you are already working on it.

## General Discussion

Some ideas may need more involved discussion and/or discussion within the team rather than in public, e.g. suggesting particular ideas for technical projects, or suggesting candidates for a mentoring scheme. Issues like this can be discussed by R Contribution Team/Forwards members in the [team chat](https://github.com/orgs/forwards/teams/r-core-contribution).
