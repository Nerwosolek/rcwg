# Ideas Incubator 2021

Between our July and September 2021 meetings we will asynchronously generate and discuss ideas for the R Contribution Working Group (RCWG) in its second year.

## Background

So far the RCWG has

 - Created the [R Contribution Site](https://forwards.github.io/rcontribution/) as a place for people interested in contributing to R to find information and resources.
 - Set up the [R-Devel Slack](https://forwards.github.io/rcontribution/slack) as a supportive space for new and experienced contributors, with a clear code of conduct.
 - Developed a draft version of the [R Developer Guide](https://forwards.github.io/rdevguide), a user-friendly introduction to contributing to R.
 - Organized, prepared and delived two Contributor-focused tutorials at useR! 2021: "Contributing to R" and "Translating R to your language"

For more details see the [closed issues](https://github.com/forwards/rcontribution/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) and the Forwards News in the [R Journal](https://journal.r-project.org/).

As well as these specific developments, we have had discussions on broader issues, such as barriers to inclusion and supporting use of git/GitHub - see the [open issues](https://github.com/forwards/rcontribution/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen) 
and [meeting minutes](https://github.com/forwards/rcontribution/tree/master/team_minutes).

## Propose Ideas on GitHub 

**From: Now!**  
**To: Friday September 17, 2021, 14:00-15:00 UTC ([find your local time](https://arewemeetingyet.com/UTC/2021-09-17/14:00/R%20Contribution%20Working%20Group))**

As in the past year, you may propose an idea for an initiative that could be implemented in the short-term (completed with the year) or a bigger idea that we can make a contribution to progressing.

1. Open an issue to propose your idea.
2. Label it as <kbd>short term goal</kbd> or <kbd>long term goal</kbd>.
3. If you are not able to bring the idea to the September RCWG meeting (Friday September 24, 2021, 14:00-15:00 UTC), label it as <kbd>needs sponsor</kbd>.

The proposer or a sponsor should be willing to make the case for the idea at the RCWG meeting. Ideally, they would also be willing to carry the idea forward with support from the group, but that is not essential.

## Discuss Ideas on GitHub

**From: Now!**  

Everyone is encouraged to discuss the ideas proposed in GitHub issues. 

Use comments to:
 - Give suggestions for refinements/implementation details.
 - Offer to sponsor an idea that needs a sponsor (then remove the <kbd>needs sponsor</kbd> label).
 - Offer to contribute to implementing the idea; if possible, specify what role(s) you could play. (If you are part of the Forwards GitHub organization, you may assign yourself to the issue). 

Use emoji to:
 - Show your support for the idea.
 - Agree with other people's comments.

## Prioritise Ideas at the September RCWG meeting

**Date: Friday September 24, 2021, 14:00-15:00 UTC  ([find your local time](https://arewemeetingyet.com/UTC/2021-09-24/14:00/R%20Contribution%20Working%20Group))**

Proposors/sponsors will put the ideas forward at the September meeting. The meeting will then decide to 

1. Adopt idea as a current task for the R Contribution Team and start work/determine next steps.
2. Postpone decision till next meeting allowing for further discussion on GitHub/more volunteers to be found/relevant information to be gathered.
3. Reject idea for the short-term.

In order to sponsor an idea, it must first be proposed on GitHub, at least a week before the meeting.

Meeting details will be posted on the [R-Devel Slack Group](https://forwards.github.io/rcontribution/slack), or you can email rowforwards@gmail.com to be added to/removed from the mailing list to receive meeting invitations.
