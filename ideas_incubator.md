# [R Contribution Working Group](https://contributor.r-project.org/working-group): Ideas Incubator 2022

Between our July and September 2022 meetings we will asynchronously generate and discuss ideas for the R Contribution Working Group (RCWG) to work on in its third year.

## Background

Since September 2022 the RCWG:

 - Explored R's Bugzilla ([report](https://llrs.github.io/bugzilla_viz/)) and developed a prototype [Shiny app](https://github.com/llrs/open_bugs) to highlight bugs needing attention. 
 - Further developed the R Contribution Site, which is now hosted at https://contributor.r-project.org/. 
 - Set up the [@R_Contributors](https://twitter.com/R_Contributors) Twitter account. 
 - Presented the [R Development Guide](https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide) at LatinR 2021 ([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzPia_PAxvw))
 - Ran [Collaboration Campfires](https://contributor.r-project.org/events/collaboration-campfires) as part of the [Digital Infrastructure Incubator](https://incubator.codeforscience.org/cohort), supported by a grant from Code for Science and Society.
 - Went on the [R podcast](https://r-podcast.org/034-collaborative-campfires/) to talk about RCWG initiatives.
 - Organized a [Bug BBQ](https://contributor.r-project.org/events/bug-bbq) as a satellite event to useR! 2022.
 - Reviewed the status of [translations](https://blog.r-project.org/2022/07/25/r-can-use-your-help-translating-r-messages/index.html) and [Translation Teams](https://developer.r-project.org/TranslationTeams.html). Set up a [Weblate server](https://translate.rx.studio/projects/r-project/) for testing as a translation contribution platform.
 - Mentored two Google Summer of Code projects: Track R Translations Status ([proposal](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2022/wiki/Track-R-Translations-Status), [dashboard](https://github.com/r-devel/translations)) and [Converting past R Journal articles to HTML](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2022/wiki/Converting-past-R-Journal-articles-to-HTML).
 - Began a [Google Season of Docs project](https://github.com/rstats-gsod/gsod2022/wiki/GSOD-2022-Proposal) to update the R Development Guide.
