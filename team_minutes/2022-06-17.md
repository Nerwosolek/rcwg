2. Plans for Bug Barbecue (https://github.com/r-devel/rcontribution/issues/18)
    - Webpage created: https://contributor.r-project.org/events/bug-bbq
        - Zoom provided by RStudio. Will have RStudio host for each session, they need to be present to create breakout rooms (or assign alternate host)
    - RStudio will provide Workbench with current R-Devel (set up by Solutions Engineers David Aja and Cole Arendt):
        >  * We’ve provisioned a test environment which that will enable users to log into workbench with their GitHub identity
        > * We’ll be doing some work next week to improve the security and performance of that environment
       > * We’ll provide an R-devel installation alongside other versions of R so it’s easy for users to switch between versions
       > * Having this environment support changes to R itself is pretty complicated, so it’s unlikely we’ll be able to support that workflow
    - Set up Bug BBQ repo: https://github.com/r-devel/bug-bbq.
    - Arranged (some) volunteers for each session: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xC4rL6aWSE-ITIPQME57XIw7-W7bfY0Lg8DocPLeZ-k/edit#gid=1261206945
    - Contacted potential triagers to help set up repo/triage bugs during session.
    - TODO:
        - Edit "Introduction to Contribution" to ~1.5 hours.
        - Create "Welcome to Bug BBQ", 5-10 minute introduction to get experienced contributors started, possibly recorded.
        - Set up #bug-bbq channel on Slack
        - Add Zoom registration links to webpage and advertise
        - Add bugs as issues to GitHub repo (https://github.com/r-devel/bug-bbq).
        - Update instructions about access to different R versions, with info about workbench: maybe this replaces current info? Will we need instructions to clone r-svn repo [or svn repository]?
        - Add tips for how to edit R functions given source code
    - Discussion: R-Devel might want help with Windows bugs, checking that they still exist.
    - Would help if people can go through and identify bugs where they can help.
    - There are some open documentation bugs.

3. Collaboration Campfires (https://github.com/r-devel/rcontribution/issues/11)
    - Last one of series in May. Looking at how to contribute translation. Have draft blog post on current status of translations in R and how people can contribute.

4. Google Season of Docs (GSoD) (https://github.com/r-devel/rcontribution/issues/11) 
    - Project now started on expanding the R Development Guide  https://github.com/rstats-gsod/gsod2022/wiki/GSOD-2022-Proposal
    - Starting work on translation chapter
    - A chapter on the alternative GitHub workflow for testing and creating patches
    
5. Google Summer of Code (GSoC) (https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2022) [Heather Turner]
