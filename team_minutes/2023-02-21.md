    - Big patch now committed: https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/commit/dd4ed6ffc9b620c7b4a92f8cb9dab9ecc8b5890c
        - Failed Windows tests on GitHub as RTools needed updating (fixed here: https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/commit/9751ec2e802ba91e96dda6cb20e22a1ca4af3977). Would be nice to have equivalent of rsync-recommended for getting correct R tools for given R version, to avoid similar breakage in future. GB may follow up on this idea.

- useR! 2023
    - Full conference pushed to 2024. Potentially some bridging events to be organized, e.g. local one day in person events + some online events. Still being worked out.
    - Could still run events as in past years
        - Bug BBQ. Would be good to run again: provide annual opportunity for people to contribute, even if they can't contribute regularly.
        - Translatathon. Idea of AsiaR translatathon has been on the backburner for a while, this could be an opportunity to do it. Potentially contact BiocAsia community to identify local volunteers. 
        - GB willing to run Contributing to R training again. Might be better to save this for in person conference unless other tutorials are being organized and we can lean on that organization.
