- R Development Container 
    - Initial version ready for testing: https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-env, demonstrated at the Contributor Office Hour
    - Artharva has been working on updates to the README: some minor improvements to existing documentation, plus in-progress section on running the container locally (https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-env/tree/codespace-start-stop)
    - If you want to try: test out version 0.1 on the main branch. A video of the demo was shared on Slack. 

- R Translation dashboard (https://contributor.r-project.org/translations/)
    - Shrish couldn't make the meeting
    - Brief update from Gabe (a mentor on the project): some updates already made on production version. Other updates in development, lots of new plots
    - Dashboard is updated once a day - will investigate if it could be triggered on demand as this might be useful for the sprint.
    - In-development dashboard is here: https://shrish-shete20.github.io/weblate/New-Dashboard.html.
