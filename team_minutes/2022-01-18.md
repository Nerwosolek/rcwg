    - Should tweet about new posts on the R Developer Blog. R Foundation account does this, but no harm to boost signal. HT to set up IFTTT.

 - Volunteer communications assistant and/or R-Ladies liaison positions still vacant (to takeover from Kara Woo).
 - Contributing tutorial still needs to go up on website
     - Gabe will work on PR for this
 - Plan to set up mailing list for event announcements
 - Are we going to blog about the RCWG? So it can be shared on R-bloggers. E.g. call for participation. Advantage is that many people already signed up to this.
     - We do currently add news items to R Weekly, but this might help to reach a wider audience.
     - We could invite guest bloggers documenting their experience contributing to R.
     - What about the R Developer blog - could that be aggregated by R Bloggers and R Weekly? Michael Lawrence will follow up on this.
     - Analysis of Bugzilla by Lluís could go on R Developer blog as way of introducing group.
 - Idea: maybe ask the R Podcast (https://r-podcast.org/) to announce our events, Eric Nantz would probably do it. HT will get in contact.

3. Outreach of R Development Guide (https://github.com/r-devel/rcontribution/issues/11)

 - Collaborative Campfires planned for last Tuesday of the month, starting 25 January. Planning to start with Bugzilla orientation.
 - Potential for some exercises using BugRzilla package? 
 - Perhaps use Shiny app highlighting bugs that need attention? (c.f. https://github.com/r-devel/rcontribution/issues/16)

4. Bug Barbecue (https://github.com/r-devel/rcontribution/issues/18)

 - Aiming to hold in parallel with useR!. HT to contact useR! organizers about this.
 - Collaboration Campfires will help prepare people to take part in this event.

5. Translation. Mike C and Michael L getting this group into gear.
    - Yani and Elio are good people to contact to get in touch with re Spanish translations.
    - Only a couple of languages currently actively maintained. Some not updated for several version. Surprisingly Spanish is not that up-to-date.
    - Part of work is to improve clarity of the English message in the first place.
    - Reaching out to academic organizations related to ethnic/language groups, such as SACNAS (https://www.sacnas.org/)? Also R-Ladies, AfricaR, AsiaR, etc.
   [Post-meeting: added to GitHub issues and project board: https://github.com/r-devel/rcontribution/issues/28]

 - HT can look into and get in contact with Bioconductor.
 - Gabe still willing to contribute.

6. GSoC/GSoD [Google Summer of Code/ Google Season of Docs]
 - We should think if there is any potential to propose a project related to the group. 
 - Otherwise, we should encourage participation from a diverse group of people.
 - GSoC 2022 (https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2022/)
     - "Beginning in 2022, we are opening the program up to all newcomers of open source that are 18 years and older."
     - "We are going to support both medium sized projects (~175 hours) and large projects (~350 hours) in 2022."
     - Increased Flexibility of Timing for Projects - can extend from 12 to 22 weeks
     - The R project often get a lot of people from India taking on these projects, possibly because the stipend is relatively more attractive (even though the stipends are adjust for economic group of the country where the participants live). 
 - GSoD 2022 (https://github.com/rstats-gsod/gsod2022/)
     - Not announced yet. Longer project, potential to offer professional rates.
