## Agenda

- Welcome

- Office hours (https://github.com/r-devel/rcontribution/issues/32)
    - Session notes: https://github.com/r-devel/rcontribution/blob/main/office_hours/
    - Ran again on December 1 and January 12, booked times for February 9 and March 9.
        - Would work better for Gabe to have AMER hour shifted 30min later
        - HT to check with Elin
    - Several sign-ups on LinkedIn, but high no-show rate. Only one non-facilitator attended in Dec/Jan.
    - Still made use of time to look at bugs, leading to following fixes:
        - https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16158
        - https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16305
    - Changes to R Dev Guide made in GSoD 2022 have been helpful, e.g pointed new contributor to this, who subsequently got set up to build R on Linux; also used as reference for lifecycle of a patch.
    - Attendance
        - Using Zoom registration vs sharing details didn't seem to help (no sign-ups that way)
        - Will ask R Consortium if we can have a group on their Meetup Pro account.
        - Should also promote via R Weekly.

- Translation via Weblate (https://translate.rx.studio/)
    - Gergely Daróczi has prepared a patch on Slack: https://r-contributors.slack.com/archives/C0210D7EN1X/p1674051583230129
        - Updates since the summer
        - Contributions to 8 languages: Portuguese, Chinese (Simplified), English (United Kingdom), French, Albanian, Spanish, Korean, Italian
        - 18 contributors, 3486 strings
        - Can see impact of LatinR translatathon. Community introduces a bit of friendly competition!
        - Potential contacts for AsiaR translatathon if/when we run that.
    - There is a dashboard that you can look at : https://translate.rx.studio/projects/r-project/#languages
    - GB: Could be award badges for certain number of translations?
            - GD: Will look into this. List of top 10 translators: https://translate.rx.studio/stats/
    - GD: Will check on the high percentage of failling checks as GB pointed out. Probably due to the trailing whitespace in Japanese translations?
    - AN: Will start working on translation to British English.
    - AD: Will look at French translations.

- Google season of docs 
    - 2022 (https://github.com/r-devel/rcontribution/issues/31)

                - Collate experience from R package developers

    - Creating a Linux Container to build R-devel on Windows (maybe also Mac?). As discussed in November RCWG meeting.
