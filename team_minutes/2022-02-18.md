3. Outreachy internships (https://github.com/r-devel/rcontribution/issues/15, https://www.outreachy.org/) [HT]
    - Application in progress: https://developer.r-project.org/etherpad/p/PHHJ_0WSFUOTPebl63dW
    - Bioconductor are onboard (Jen Wokaty, core developer). Depends on project regarding who will be a mentor.
    - RStudio also helping prepare application (Tracy Teal, Open Source Program Director). Have own internship program, so may not be able to help this time re mentorship. Still happy to connect with interns, e.g. virtual tour of RStudio.
    - Community application and individual applications due Feb 25.
        - HT and JW will tweet/post soon to raise awareness among potential candidates
    - Mentors sign up and propose projects by Mar 4.
    - Raised code of conduct issue https://github.com/r-devel/rcontribution/issues/30
        - In short-term, we can show our work in progress on this issue.
    - Should do wrap up at the end to see what we can learn for next time. RStudio needs to plan quite far ahead, e.g. Oct/Nov for May cohort.
    - How would funds be organized to pay interns? Potentially R Foundation, or Open Collective. OC may be better for international payments.

4. GSoD (Google Season of Docs) [Rachitt Shah]
    - Discussion of potential projects has started: https://github.com/rstats-gsod/gsod2022/issues

Saranjeet and Heather were hosted on this podcast to talk about Collaboration Campfires (https://r-podcast.org/034-collaborative-campfires/). The host, Eric Nantz, is happy to host us or others in future, to report back on the Campfires or to discuss other RCWG intiatives.
