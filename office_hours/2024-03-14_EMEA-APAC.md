## Discussion

### substr issue (EK)

 - trying to get a regex that would find three consecutive letters in a row
 - was able to do with stringr package
 - tried with base::substr
     - all but first elements of `start` and `stop` are ignored, doesn't seem to be well documented
 - tried with substring
    - works, but has different arguments `first` and `last`, which *do* seem to be vectorized
 - should base::substr have a warning when arguments are ignored?

    - maybe a lot of other base R functions behave like this

    - maybe warn "start and stop don't have the same length as x so only values up to the length of x will be used" or something like that.

 - should it be documented better?
    - maybe should point in direction of base::substring instead of substr as more appropriate here

    - maybe need clearer documentation about when to use substr vs substring
 - it is documented that substr returns value the same length of x. So if repeat x, start and stop are recycled/vectorized.
 - could add example where some elements are ignored.
 - is documented in stringr: https://stringr.tidyverse.org/articles/from-base.html#str_sub-extract-and-replace-substrings-from-a-character-vector
  - Reading substring() source code, it repeats all the arguments to the same length and then calls substr.
    ```r
    function (text, first, last = 1000000L)
    {
      if (!is.character(text))
        text <- as.character(text)
      n <- max(lt <- length(text), length(first), length(last))
      if (lt && lt < n)
        text <- rep_len(text, length.out = n)
      .Internal(substr(text, as.integer(first), as.integer(last)))
    }
    ```

    Maybe add something like this to substr:
    ```r
    n <- length(x)
    if (n < length(start) || n < length(stop)) {
      warning(sprintf(ngettext(n,
                               "start or stop are longer than x. Only the first %i value will be used.",
                               "start or stop are longer than x. Only the first %i values will be used."),
                               n))
    }
    ```

 ACTION
  - propose improvement to documentation
  - suggest adding a warning (could be opened as separate bug report)

 ### Multingual Documentation Working Group

 - Elio, Pao and Renata are setting up a working group for translation of help pages

     - Likely to involve several members of R Core and the wider R community (particularly rOpenSci).

    - Cover both translation, infrastructure, tutorials

    - Will advertise on #core-translation and interested for other suggestions
