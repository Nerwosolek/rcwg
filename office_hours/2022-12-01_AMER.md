## Review of EMEA-APAC session

We looked at this bug: https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16158

## Further discussion

1. Would be good to have wider discussion - was it discussed previously on R-devel mailing list? 
    - Doesn't seem so from checking the archive.

2. Which other model does this affect in base R or the recommended packages?

In a vanilla R session:
    
methods(predict)
 [1] predict.ar*                predict.Arima*            
 [3] predict.arima0*            predict.glm               
 [5] predict.HoltWinters*       predict.lm                
 [7] predict.loess*             predict.mlm*              
 [9] predict.nls*               predict.poly*             
[11] predict.ppr*               predict.prcomp*           
[13] predict.princomp*          predict.smooth.spline*    
[15] predict.smooth.spline.fit* predict.StructTS*  

    - Doesn't seem relevant to spline prediction
    - predict.mlm doesn't call predict.lm, but would expect same principles to apply there
    - predict.glm does call predict.lm, but as discussed in EMEA/APAC office hour, glm does not use QR, so nonest.basis.lm won't work

At least within base R and probably recommended packages, would want consistent behaviour.

2. Should a warning still be given even if we can return NA where it is not estimable?
 - Yes!
 
3. A lot of packages will rely on predict.lm - how will affect them?
 - Shouldn't be a problem if they use predict.lm directly/indirectly
 - If they don't use, won't benefit from enhancement, but not a concern for us

4. Making a change could affect tests in contributed packages as well as base R/recommended packages.

## Proposed TODO

1. Test:
    - Could run tests by copy-pasting relevant snippets from estimability package into predict.lm: see what breaks!
    - Would at least give an idea of impact of fixing for specific case of ordinary linear regression.
2. Discuss test results on Slack
