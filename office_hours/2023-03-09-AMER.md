## Review

March EMEA/APAC Office hour
    - We discussed building R-devel on macOS and looked at a bug being analysed on the #work-out-loud channel on the R-devel Slack
    
January Office Hours:
    - We browsed bugs on Buzilla and briefly discussed a few. Heather followed up on this bug: https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16305, which is now CLOSED FIXED with a documentation patch
    - We discussed adding the Palmer Penguins dataset to base R. Ella Kaye and Heather are collaborating with the palmerpenguins authors to follow up on this. We also discussed some general issues related to package development.
    
## Discussion

### What skills are required to attend R Project Sprint?

Depends!
  - Main requirement: interest in contributing longer term. Some experience e.g. of package development.
  - Could work on translations
  - Could work on projects such as: https://contributor.r-project.org/r-project-sprint-2023/short-projects/quartz-alpha-mask/ - that requires some familiarity with C, also knowledge of building R on MacOs (could be helped with this before the sprint)
  - Could work on documentation: would require familiarity with R and relevant statistical/computational method
  - Some patches only require R code, e.g. wishlist items to extend functionality of a function a little bit.
  
### Building R from Source

 - Debartha is trying to build R on Windows
 - Instructions here https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/GetStart.html#windows will install Subversion for you. A client isn't really necessary as to start with you just need to check out the R-devel sources.

### Getting bug in R resolved
 - Coen is maintainer of GPArotation for many years. Has found bug in factanal and has submitted proposed patches.
 - 5 current bugs: https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/GetStart.html#windows. First 2 are related and Coen has submitted patches for both.
 - Need to wait for someone on R Core to engage with the bug, no way to force this to happen. May need to wait for specific people too - e.g. some members of R Core will focus more on statistical methods, or have responsibility for specific part of codebase.
 - Less likely to get resolved if there is any disagreement about it being a bug or how to fix it.
 - Narrow patches more likely to get accepted: easier for R Core member to review and commit to maintain.
 - May help to include output that demonstrates the bug in the comments, so its easier for R Core to review (don't have to download and run example scripts).
 - Can check in R-devel if anything has actually been changed. And test if it has been changed. Can get binaries of R-devel from mac.r-project.org. Can use RSwitch to allow you to install and use different versions of R.
 - Perhaps ask a colleague/collaborator with expertise in factor analysis to review bug report/patch and add their view.
