## Discussion

### Palmer Penguins dataset

Ella proposes adding the {palmerpenguin}s package data to the base R datesets package, for all the reasons given is this article: https://journal.r-project.org/articles/RJ-2022-020/

 - https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins
 - https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/palmerpenguins/index.html

Heather recalls there was some conversation about this on twitter a while back, with Thomas Lumley (on the R Core Team) being open to the idea. Relevant bit starts from this post: https://twitter.com/nj_tierney/status/1270145612311171072.

See also this article on the story of palmerpenguins:
https://apreshill.github.io/palmerpenguins-useR-2022/#/title-slide
Note that `penguins` is already included in Python, Julia and TensorFlow.

As well as including the data, this would also involve updating examples in base R that use `iris` with examples using `penguins`.

(Tool from Garrick Aden Buie for finding references to `iris` in your GitHub repos) https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/blog/lets-move-on-from-iris/)

How would such a change be made in base R?

 - Would need to get at least one R Core member on board
     - Start discussion on R-devel mailing list (https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-devel) or create WISHLIST issue on R's Bugzilla. (See past WISHLIST post here: https://bugs.r-project.org/buglist.cgi?component=Wishlist&product=R&resolution=---; need an account to create a new post, but anyone can view past posts)
- If support from R Core, create a patch. Since a patch would involve changing many files, it would be best to get set up so can do this locally:
    - Need to be able able to get R source from svn and build the development version of R as described in the "R Patched and Development Versions" chapter of the Dev Guide https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/GetStart.html
    - Then would create and test a patch as decribed in "Lifecycle of a Patch" chapter https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/FixBug.html (this also describes how to create and test a patch via the GitHub mirror, but this is more suited to small changes on a single file).

### Why people might create a package for a dataset

 - Easily makes it available so users just have to write `library(datapkg)` to make the data available, along with documentation
 - Many teaching datasets, e.g. nycflights13, babynames, gapminder
 - Also a way of distributing data, e.g. survey results
 
### Why people might create a package webpage

- Became popular when the pkgdown website was developed (first on CRAN in 2018). This package helps you create a website for your package.
- Most elements are created from existing material in the package sources (README, LICENSE file, DESCRIPTION, etc), though authors can add additional articles that are just on the website
 
### Help on creating packages with C++

Not so many reference materials available on this topic. Some useful materials that we know of:
    - "Make an R package with C++ code" - YouTube playlist by Toby Dylan Hocking: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwc48KSH3D1OkObQ22NHbFwEzof2CguJJ
    - Some slides from training course run in the Statistics department at Warwick (plans to revise in the summer, after which there should be a more public webpage): 
    - https://hturner.github.io/advanced-r/05_bottlenecks.html (covers converting R functions to C++)
    - https://hturner.github.io/package-development/05_Rcpp_packages.html (creating R packages with RCpp)

## Next steps:
    
Taking the Palmer Penguins idea forward:
- (EK will do this) Raise an issue on the palmerpenguins GitHub page about this, to see if the authors are supportive and whether they would like to be involved. The package is licensed with CC0, so using the data is fine, but raising an issue here first still seems like the right thing to do.
- Get a discussion started in the work-out-loud channel on the R Contributors Slack
- Put together a case for the R Core Team
- Questions to consider:
    - Could the vignette be included (hasn't been done before for a dataset package)
    - Would the data go in `raw` or would the data-generating scripts be used.
    - What happens with all the additional material, e.g. the art.
    - Presumably keep the webpage (though remove the package from cran) and link to it in the documentation
- Can look into how these questions have been handled for the inclusion in Python, Julia
