## Discussion

### Translations

- Weblate: 
    -  to contribute translations to R
    -  url: https://translate.rx.studio/projects/r-project/
    - Components: There are usually two components per package (for messages in C and R code)
    - Languages: the percentage of translated messages might be misleading (check the components - some may be completely missing)
    - Where to start: anywhere you want to. Click "Translate" and go.
    - See "Automatic suggestions" for tips/suggestions on translation
    - See "other languages" for examples of other translations of the same sentence
- R Contributors Slack for questions about translations: # core-translation channel
- Translations repo: https://github.com/r-devel/translations - holds code for translations dashboard that is in development (https://contributor.r-project.org/translations/)
    - At EMEA-APAC April office hour, we discussed keeping a page on the wiki of this github (https://github.com/r-devel/translations/wiki) for members of a team working on a language. See [Conventions for translating to Hindi](https://github.com/r-devel/translations/wiki/Conventions-for-translating-to-Hindi) for an example
- chp 8 R Development Guide needs to be updated to include weblate

### Bug reports

- Bugzilla:
   - Click "Browse" in the top menu to browse R & Rtools bugs
   - There is a category for translations (report an inconsistency, missing translation, etc): https://bugs.r-project.org/buglist.cgi?component=Translations&product=R&resolution=---
   - Example bug: 
       - Component "Translations"
       - Version "R-devel"
       - Severity "minor" (in most cases)
- Writing a bug report
    -  First need an account, see https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/BugTrack.html#RCorePkgBug 
    -  Click "New" in the top menu to start a new bug report
    -  Fill in the meta data
    -  The summary is the title of the bug, like the subject line of an email.
    -  The description can be wirtten using markdown.
    -  It is a good idea to link to the relevant code file in the Subversion repository of the R sources on https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk and copy the current Revision number so that people reviewing the bug report know which version you were looking at. 
    -  The Revision number is shown on any page that shows a list of directories, e.g. https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/gnuwin32/installer/, rather than an actual code file, e.g. https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/gnuwin32/installer/CustomMsg.iss.
    -  [Post-edit: alternatively you can add the revision number to the URL, e.g. https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/gnuwin32/installer/CustomMsg.iss?p=84259]


### Building R on Windows

Debartha was getting an error when trying to build on Windows - the pcre2.h header file was not found.

We look at the full HOW TO on https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/howto-R-devel.html and tried the following command to list installed packages in MSys2

```
pacman -Q
```
This showed pcre2 as an installed package! So we could not fix this during the office hour. Suggested to post on Contributors Slack to see if anyone else can help, or is willing to try building R on Windows themselves, to see if they get the same issue. 
It would be good to get a clearer idea of the issue before asking for help via the official channels.
