## Review

January EMEA/APAC Office hour
 - We discussed potentially adding the Palmer Penguins data to the datasets package. Opened issue on palmerpenguin GitHub repo as first step: https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/issues/95.
    
December Office Hours:
 - We looked at this bug: https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16158, 
    - This is now CLOSED FIXED after Elin restarted the discussion with a patch that she had tested on the git mirror.
    - As we suspected, the change did cause things to break on CRAN, so the previous behaviour has still been kept as the default

## Discussion

Looking together at the recent bugs, new to old: https://bugs.r-project.org/buglist.cgi?bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=CONFIRMED&bug_status=REOPENED&bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bugidtype=include&list_id=21572&order=bugs.delta_ts%20desc&query_format=advanced
 - Some patches, best reviewed by R Core, e.g. https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18438, https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18417
 - Some where Elin has already commented and is waiting for others to move forward, e.g. https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18421
 - Some where there is not support from R Core to fix, e.g. https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18429
 
Tried looking at some older bugs
 - https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18108: not clear how to fix
 - https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16305
     - Hmisc issue seems to be fixed now: maybe tighter CRAN check or authors have fixed?
     - formatting commands they mention are standard Rd markup. Is there a case for using standard LaTex markup here or is there a way to work with the Rd markup?

## TODO

- Heather will look further into bug 16305 and add comment on Bugzilla.
