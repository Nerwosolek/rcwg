## Bug Analysis

Looking at this bug: https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16158
Based on this wishlist item: https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15072

There seems to be a good case to propose a patch here. How could we do that given the  solution on Bugzilla uses a contributed package (written by the original poster)?

Issues:
    
1. Need to write version of `estimability::is.estble()`
    - Use `Recall()` rather than calling the function by name inside itself
    - Will we always apply this function to a model matrix? In which case we would always work through rows, maybe recall not necessary at all
    - Change argument name `nbasis` to e.g. `basis` (so it doesn't look like a number)
    - Change `=` to `<-` to follow base style
    - `return(TRUE)` early in case of `is.na(nbasis[1])` so else block not required

2. Consider how to implement `estimability::nonest.basis` - currently a generic, with methods for lm, qr, matrix, svd and default.
      - lm method just extracts qr component from lm model result and calls qr method
      - What to do about glm? Should be consistent, but glm doesn't use QR decomposition. Perhaps use matrix method on design matrix? This computes the SVD then calls the svd method. 
      Could compare to gnm::checkEstimable which checkes estimability in GNMs, of which glm/lm are specical cases.
