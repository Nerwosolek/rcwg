## Discussion

### rig

R Installation Manager
 - https://github.com/r-lib/rig
 - Follow README for installation instructions
 - Sets up user library - avoids problems with installing packages in system library that can happen e.g. with package check (R CMD check)
 - Mac menu bar app can open Rig.app e.g. from Spotlight, allows you to switch versions.
 - `rig add devel` to install latest version of R-devel
 - On Mac, can have issues if try to install old R versions that are only available for Intel architecture. Need to specify architecture e.g. `rig add -a x86_64 3.6` 

### colima
