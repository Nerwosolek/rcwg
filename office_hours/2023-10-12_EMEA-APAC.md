Name: Brian Terry

Something we could do or discuss together today: Any simple task I could look into to start contributing to R

## Discussion

## Penguins data (Ella Kaye)

Data currently exists in palmerpenguins package, working on proposal to add to base R. Starting point is to reproduce results from source publication. Has original scripts from authors. Has had initial discussions with Thomas Lumley (R Core member) about how to proceed. Brian would be interested in contributing to this. Ella to get in touch with Brian separately to proceed with this.

## Possible issues to start contributing on 

Had a brief look together at R's bug tracker: https://bugs.r-project.org. Good idea to customise view so that you can see number of comments (has anyone responded to the original report?) and order by last updated (avoid very old bugs initially). 

Also helpful to know names of R Core members: https://www.r-project.org/contributors.html to see if R Core support a change.

May find some good issues for new contributors from the ones that were identified for R Project Sprint 2023 - look for ones that people were note assigned to/working on at the sprint. For example:

 - Check status of https://github.com/r-devel/r-project-sprint-2023/issues/34
 - Or ideas for contribution endorsed by Luke Tierney: https://github.com/r-devel/r-project-sprint-2023/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+Endorsed+by+Luke.

## Ahamadou

Has been working on issue with t-test in statistics package - change has been committed. Would be happy to work on similar statistics bugs.
 - Possibly look at nlme bugs? These can require a lot of background reading/thought. It may help to organize a focused work session online, perhaps with Ben Bolker, Sebastian Meyer, Martyn Plummer? 

Also working on prototype package with Thomas Lumley for potential change to sample function in base R. Algorithm could be improved, but have algorithm that would be good enough for now. Waiting for R Core to take next steps.
