## Discussion

### Bugs on Bugzilla
 - We looked at R'S Bugzilla (https://bugs.r-project.org/) and an example documentation bug (https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=17770)
     - This was a case where someone had proposed a change the the docs, following a discussion on StackOverflow.
     - Martin Maechler (a member of R Core: https://www.r-project.org/contributors.html) had proposed a slightly different change. He went ahead and made the change: https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/commit/c94bf83dbfaf68d29f0d287c5edd18ab14ed2285
          - Updated overall NEWS.Rd file, referring to fix thanks to bug report
          - Updated help file for xtabs()
              - For base R we edit the R Documentation (.Rd) files directly, see https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/Doc.html for help on this format
          - Updated the .Rout.save file produced by running the examples from the help files
demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOlF8fPf9v8&ab_channel=SoftwareSaved
     - Current status: initial issue has been fixed, but bug reporter raised an outstanding issues. What could we do as the next step?
          - Review the bug report and the fix, to make sure we understand the background.
          - Decide if we think there is an outstanding issue to be fixed:
              - If so: add a brief comment to support further change. Perhaps propose what they change should look like through a comment or a patch.
                   - GitHub workflow for creating a patch: https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/FixBug.html#using-a-git-mirror
              - If not: add a brief comment to support closing the issue.
     

### Translation via Weblate

 - Briefly looked at https://translate.rx.studio/projects/r-project
     - Anyone can sign up for an account and get started on translation
     - Finding the translations for a particular language via the "Languages" menu item
     - Finding the next translation message to be fixed: choose a component and click "Translate"
     - Syntatic issues (e.g. double space) will be highlighted with a red box
         - Can fix manually, or click "fix string"
     - Once you have checked/edited the translation, uncheck "Need editing", otherwise the message will remain marked as "fuzzy" (= possibly incorrect).
  - Draft documentation on Weblate is at 
https://github.com/r-devel/rdevguide/pull/142/files#diff-475395d82ee88e462892d2ad3197e80fe249f6bda9b8efcb3ae7c5316f6a8cd8R201
