## Discussion

### Installing/building R

* https://github.com/r-lib/rig
    - For installing different versions of R, including R-devel
    - Not too much advantage for Windows users, but does separate package libraries for each installation
    - More helpful for Linux/Mac where hard to use multiple R versions

* GSoC project working on VS Code container to build R - in progess!
* virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads for loading a virtual machine on Windows - may be easier than Docker for creating a virtual machine?
    - actual virtual desktop, not just terminal
* colima may be better for MacOS
* docker for Linux
* advantage of building R on virtual machine: can't mess up work computer!

* Documentation on Building R
    - https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/
    - https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html

* Possibly rebuild R in RStudio terminal when in safe version of R (say R-release) and switch to R-devel in R server once built.
    - could work with any virtual machine in theory.
    - use Rstudio in browser

* Use vagrant + virtualbox to do initial build of R?
   - make will only rebuild parts that have changed
