## Discussion

### LatinR

Chairs (Yani, Riva and Natalia) agreed to give lightning talk slot to explain translations project. Then will have space for people to translate to Spanish or Portuguese concurrently with talks.
- Pao and Maria have been updating Spanish guidelines and glossary in preparation. Renata and/or Caio will also be there from Portuguese team. Writing guidelines in Spanish as well as English.
- Hope to get Spanish to good percentage by next year.

Is translations dashboard (https://contributor.r-project.org/translations-dashboard/) updating as expected? E.g. doesn't seem to be picking up Catalan translations. Only updating once a day at the moment.
 - Could look into updating on demand - is this doable via the GitHub action? Should check with Ben which GitHub action to use. HT: will ask Ben for status update before the R Contribution Working Group meeting next week.
 - Screen with Weblate may be better for live updates!
 
 For future/other events - maybe a poster would be better/useful as well, since could then have in multiple languages. At LatinR, posters are near the end so not so good for advertising.
 
 At useR! could have at least one slide with multiple languages linking to guidelines for different languages.
 
### Internationalisation project

Elio and Renata have made a related R Consortium Infrastructure Steering Committee submission to work on package with prototype mechanism with showcase package in Spanish. May create R Consortium Working Group related to this.
- enables R to support some packages having documentation in multiple languages
- some packages have specific demographic, e.g. data packages specific to particular countries with official language other than English
- some key/widely used packages, e.g. tidyverse.
- also consider vignettes; possible more important than individual help pages. Would want to do in a way that doesn't duplicate computation when building vignettes. Maybe quarto/R markdown extension to use different languages.
- same issue with running examples in multiple help files. For now would leave examples (comments, variable names) alone.
- issues with translating prose vs message. LatinR community has some experience with this, e.g. translating meaning vs literal translation. Starting with messages helps provide a foundation for this. Probably want to translate paragraph or help section vs individual sentences.
- may want to test with two languages, ideally including one more problematic language, e.g. non-Latin or right-to-left. German could be prgamatic choice as members of R Core could test.

## Guidelines

Is there anything in place to ensure they don't diverge?

https://contributor.r-project.org/translations/ has general guidelines, language-specific sections are really the pain points for that particular language - not so likely to apply to other languages.

Also have reviewers (team leaders) to review and accept translations. But if string remains unreviewed for some time, may still be accepted as better than nothing. New people at LatinR will not be able to accept translations.
