## Review of EMEA-APAC Office Hour

We looked at this bug: https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=17863 and tracked it down to a problem in print.loadings().

What's best to do next: add a comment or write a patch?

Elin Waring (experienced bug triager) suggests to write a comment, so we work on this together. Output: https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=17863#c1.

## Look at related bug

We have some time left, so start to look at a related bug that Elin came across recently: https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18417. 

We think that the bug reporter's proposed solution should replace this line: https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/blob/master/src/library/stats/R/factanal.R#L33.

TODO
 - Test it with the example data from ?factanal
 - Check it on a 1-factor example 
 - Check it does not change the results in the orthogonal case
 
Come back to this in the next office hours if no one has looked in the meantime!
