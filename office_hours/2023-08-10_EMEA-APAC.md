## Warm up 

Please tell us a bit about yourself, following the template below: 

Name: Heather Turner   
Country I am currently in: UK 
Something we could do or discuss together today: 

Name: Ahmadou Dicko
Country I am currently in: Senegal
Something we could do or discuss together today: Ideas for the sprint

Name: Hanne Oberman
Country I am currently in: Netherlands
Something we could do or discuss together today: Preparation for the sprint

## Discussion

### Ideas for the sprint

 * Ahamadou has some ideas for enhancing sample.int for unequal probability sampling 
    - Thinking how to do this with non-breaking change, probably a new argument
    - Or possibly improve documentation, so at least not misleading
    - Working on C++ implementation, new to C programming
    - Hopes to write-up this weekend for the sprint website
    - Will also open Wishlist item on Bugzilla

### How will sprint projects be assigned?

* Still gathering ideas and proposal at the moment - expect more to appear on GitHub Discussions in the next week or so!
    - Ideas and proposals can be converted to GitHub issues so that people can assign themselves to an issue before the sprint
    - It will be possible to choose a project or change projects when you are at the sprint
    - Heather is beginning to match people to projects informally, seeing what gaps there are
    - We may have some "misc" projects that are simply working through issues on Bugzilla, e.g. looking at old issues to see if they are still relevant

### How to catch up with C material?

* The modern C material is probably too much to fit in now if you haven't started already
    - Suggest instead: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/ - more accessible material with linked exercises
    - Chapters 1 & 2 of Modern C may still be helpful as a basic orientation (corresponds to Level 0 in the book), e.g. structure of a program, how to compile.
    - [Post edit: may also want to read the chapter on R's C interface from Advanced R (1st ed.): http://adv-r.had.co.nz/C-interface.html]
