## Discussion

### Building R-Devel

Some comments on R-Devel Slack about people finding it hard to build R-Devel. Depends on platform as to whether we will be able to help.

Currently nothing in R Dev Guide about installing R-Devel on MacOS - this is an outstanding issue from the Google Season of Docs 2022 project. Heather plans to follow-up with some potential/interested writers in the next few weeks.

Meanwhile, official documentation here: https://mac.r-project.org

Some unofficial tools that may help:
 - https://github.com/coatless-mac/macrtools
 - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75595875/how-do-i-build-r-from-sources-on-macos

Also important is how to use multiple versions of R on the Mac - the official documentation mentiones RSwitch, but there is also rig (https://github.com/r-lib/rig).

### Walk-through debugging/fixing https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16256

This is an issue that is being worked on in the #work-out-loud channel on Slack. Heather demonstrated the bug and an issue that had been identified by Debartha Paul. She also demonstrated how the function could be patched and tested interactively from a checkout of the r-svn GitHub mirror. In order for a function redefined in the global environment to find internal functions from the original base package, the namespace must be set as follows:

```
source("~/Documents/Repos/r-svn/src/library/stats/R/lm.R")
environment(predict.lm) <- asNamespace('stats')
```

This works when patching a top-level function or method, e.g if we are testing example code with a call to `predict` or `predict.lm`. However if we need to change an internal function, or the method for a generic called by that top-level function/method, this approach doesn't work. We can use a hack in this case to get the redefined function from the global environment, e.g.
    
```
predictor <- get("napredict.exclude", ".GlobalEnv")(na.act, predictor)
```
vs

```
predictor <- napredict(na.act, predictor)
```
but this is no longer a valid change to the codebase. This is why for complex changes we need to be able to re-build R to make changes, so that we can update functions properly within their package namespace.
