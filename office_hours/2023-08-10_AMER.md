## Discussion

### Translation
 - Maria has been trying to collate information from the Slack and past minutes about what is going on regarding translations
     - Access for anyone with link: https://hackmd.io/qYz_6rlCRiauzDh-z9G8Mw?view
     - There is an open issue on the dev guide to add documentation about Weblate: https://github.com/r-devel/rdevguide/pull/142. Potentially some of this information could be added to this PR or to a PR that builds on this.
- As well as the weblate project (https://contributor.r-project.org/r-project-sprint-2023/projects/weblate-improvements/), there are a couple more translation projects expected at the sprint
    - A general translation project, focusing on Hindi, Japanese, Spanish and possibly Arabic (where we have multiple participants that speak that language)
        - This group could also work on developing conventions e.g. for gendered languages, when to borrow English words, etc and guidelines for developing a glossary.
    - One related to the Mac GUI (https://github.com/r-devel/r-project-sprint-2023/discussions/12) adding those translations to Weblate.
- Expect people working on any translation-related project to work closely and other people focusing on other projects that are contributing to translations (or are interested in doing so) may join some of the conversations.
- Potential issue detected with the translations dashboard: languages seem to have a different number of translations to do? It may depend on packages added in manual processes to weblate
     
### Documentation
 - Elio has created PR on sprint repo for documentation project: https://github.com/r-devel/r-project-sprint-2023/pull/17 (merged during the office hour!)
     - Improving examples
     - Working on open documentation issues
- Suggesting some new issues to work on - not opened on Bugzilla yet.
      - What would R Core prefer: many narrow documentation patches, or a small number of combined patches?
      - May be different from usual practice, since expect many patches to be submitted at the same time during the sprint.
      - Gabe suggests to ask on the R-devel mailing list.

### Contribution
 - Shreshtha is new to contribution, so we had a quick look at R's Bugzilla.
 - For an introduction to contribution take a look at the tutorials and demos here: https://contributor.r-project.org/tutorials/ particularly the Contributing to R tutorial.
