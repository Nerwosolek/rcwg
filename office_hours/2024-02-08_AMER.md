## Discussion

### Internationalisation of R help pages

 - Elio Campitelli gave an update on the internationalisation of R help pages project: https://github.com/eliocamp/rhelpi18n
     - He is working with Michael Lawrence and Deepayan Sarkar from R Core on this.
     - They will use the #core-translation channel on the R Contributors Slack for communication rather than email, so other people can see any discussions
     - Currently Rd files are translated in advance in a separate package for a specific package. Package only needs to be installed, not loaded. Requires searching through installed packages (can be slow - another topic that was discussed at R Project Sprint).
     - Will have field in DESCRIPTION "Translates" saying which package it translates and another field specifying which version of the package it translates, so you can tell if it is out-dated.
 - Gabe asked about treatment of keywords, see end of https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Documenting-functions. There is also \concept for non-standard keywords. Maybe a non-issue as perhaps not widely used apart from `internal` which is effectively a codeword.
 - What about NEWS file? Can be browsed with utils::NEWS().
 - Eventually using PO files may be best to be able to detect when parts of out of date.
 - Two main use cases: package author translates their own package or community members translate popular package.

     - even if author does original translation can still be helpful for community to help maintain

    - but authors might want to support official translations

    - may be good to discuss e.g. with Posit

 - Using machine translation? Not so good for technical writing.
 - Might be able to use some existing tools, e.g. tools::checkRdContents to check for inconsistencies between code and translated help file.
 - Treat the translation package like a test for the package, see if examples in Rd files break with a newer version. Or even run the package tests for a higher-level check.
 - One of the actions is to create a working group - how to go about this? Suggest to contact Joe Rickert.
