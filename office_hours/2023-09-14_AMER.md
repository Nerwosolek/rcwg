## Discussion

### Reviewing issues Gabe was involved in at the sprint

https://github.com/r-devel/r-project-sprint-2023/issues/67 - both Gabe and Luke have written working versions that Luke will compare

https://github.com/r-devel/r-project-sprint-2023/issues/70 - Luke did a bit of work on this at the sprint

https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18587 - Gabe was there for conceptual discussions. Luke has committed patch that was begun at the sprint by Charlie Gao. Note in svn commit message:

> r85141 | luke | 2023-09-13 12:51:48 -0700 (Wed, 13 Sep 2023) | 3 lines

> Export closeNode, recvData, recvOneData, and sendData generic for alternate
communications backends to add methods. Contributed by Charlie Gao in PR18587.

### Discussing credit for contributions

Person that submits patch will get credit - should consider if any other collaborators should get credit and mention them on Bugzilla as appropriate.

All contributors were listed in the NEWS.md for the hex code patch:
    
> \item Hexadecimal string colour specifications are now accepted
      in short form, so, for example, we can use \code{"#123"}, which is
      equivalent to \code{"#112233"}.
>
>   Thanks to MikeFC for the original idea and Ella Kaye, Malcolm
    Barrett, George Stagg, Hanne Oberman, and Michael Chirico for the
    patch.
      
Much harder issue to credit translators...

 - How to find out translators for a particular language. Not yet on dashboard (https://contributor.r-project.org/translations). 
 - Issue to follow up with R Contribution Working Group/Michael Lawrence. Some sort of TRANSLATION-NEWS file in the doc folder next to the NEWS files that lists everyone that contributed translations included in patch from Weblate, by language. Gergely has produced such summaries and shared on Slack in the past, added in commit message: https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/commit/dd4ed6ffc9b620c7b4a92f8cb9dab9ecc8b5890c
 - Creationg of teanslation news file could be part of creating a patch. Harder to capture translations that don't come through weblate though.
 - Only include people with real name available in credits?
