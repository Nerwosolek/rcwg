## Discussion

### Finding bugs to work on 

 - [Bug spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bhfPIJQXeKpydigMH79FKIkdHO9NxlBSB_bTRoCFnPY/edit), also pinned to #getting-started channel on R Contributors Slack
     - Notes from bugs that have been reviewed e.g. in preparation from R Project Sprint 
     - Zhian has been looking at it and is not sure about what categories mean
         - "patch welcome" - this means there has been a positive response from R Core, encouraging contributors to submit a patch.
 - Looking at bugs on R's Bugzilla: https://bugs.r-project.org
     - bug importance - critical ones are in red, enhancements are in grey
     - can search for bugs by severity using advanced search
     - different ways that a "bug" is identified as a wishlist item
        - Bug reporters can pick the Wishlist component when reporting a bug and/or select "enhancement" as bug severity level
        - R Core can change the status of any bug to WISHLIST
     - bug severity
        - Also selected by bug reporters
        - Generally leave as "normal" unless fixing a typo or similar (then can select minor/trivial) or causing a crash or similar (then select major/critical/blocker)
  - Zhian may contribute some content for the Navigating bugzilla section of the R Dev Guide
  - Taking a look at https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18255 as has worked on tricky namespace issues before.
