## Overview of Contributing to R

Main ways of contributing to the core project are helping with R bugs and contributing translations. But we are happy to talk about other ways of contributing, e.g. package development.

Quick introduction to R's Bugzilla: https://bugs.r-project.org
 - How to browse bugs, a look at some example bug reports

      - How to Help Review R Bug Reports: https://github.com/r-devel/rcontribution/blob/main/collaboration_campfires/materials/how_to_help_review_r_bugs.md
 
Quick introduction to translation using Weblate: https://translate.rx.studio/projects/r-project
 - Overview of the translation files, demo of adding new translations
 - Look at where translations end up in the R sources (https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/, or the GitHub mirror, e.g. https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/blob/master/src/library/base/po/R-de.po)
 
 ## Looking together at an open bug
 
First check bug is still an issue in R-devel (Heather had installed R-devel from the Mac binary just before the office hour).

Installing multiple versions of R on a Mac/Windows:
-  Follow instructions here: https://groundhogr.com/many/
- Can download devel version of R for Mac OS at https://mac.r-project.org/

In the session we take a look at the factanal print bug: https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=17863

The issue appears to be in the `print.factanal` function which we can view with `View(stats:::print.factanal)`

Try debugging with 
   `debug(stats:::print.factanal)` 
    
Digging deeper, the problem appears to be in `stats:::print.loadings`

Issue in the `if (sort)` section, in Line 10: need a `drop = FALSE` 

Next steps: report back or create a patch!
