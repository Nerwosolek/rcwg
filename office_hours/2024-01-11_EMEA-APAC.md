## Discussion

### Getting a patch file from multiple commits

Last time we worked on adding a reference to the help file for the `trees` data (https://github.com/r-devel/rcwg/blob/main/office_hours/2023-12-14_EMEA-APAC.md#cherry-trees).

We created a patch using the GitHub mirror (see the forked repository here: https://github.com/tpd5/r-svn/tree/patch-1) and submitted it via Bugzilla (https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18636).

Unfortunately, the patch we made only included the changes from the last commit on GitHub, not all the changes we had made. To include all the changes, we need to follow this workflow:
 - Make changes in a fork and commit them
 - From the home page for the branch where the changes are made (e.g. https://github.com/tpd5/r-svn/tree/patch-1), click on the link that says e.g. "2 commits ahead". This opens a link comparing the branch to the master branch of the original repo. We can then do one of two things:
     1. Add `.diff` to the URL, to create a patch including all the changes (e.g. https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/compare/master...tpd5:r-svn:patch-1.diff), or
     2. Create a pull request back to the GitHub mirror, then add `.diff` to the url of the pull request (e.g. https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/pull/139.diff
An advantage of 2 is that R is built with your changes via GitHub actions and tested on different operating systems - can help to pick up any mistakes, e.g. invalid `.Rd` syntax.

### Gait data

Ella is working on adding the gait data from the fda package to base R, as a better example of a 3-d array.

Tick for getting an existing .Rd file to update:

```r
db <- tools::Rd_db("fda")
names(db)
db[["gait.Rd"]]
```

We reviewed some of the changes made:
 - Adding a reference to the fda package and the original paper where the data came from
 - Adding a note about the discrepancy between the fda version and the original paper
 - Conforming to base R conventions:
     - Common issues are listed in https://developer.r-project.org/Rds.html and https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/Doc.html#introduction-to-.rd-files.
     - Full description of .Rd syntax is in https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Writing-R-documentation-files

### Iris/penguins data

Ella is also working on adding palmerpenguins data to base R, to be used in examples over the iris data. Working through examples here: https://iris-to-penguins.netlify.app/, hevne't worked them all out yet.

`iris` is also used in some tests, perhaps discuss next time how tests work.
        
### C Study Group

Starts this month: https://contributor.r-project.org/events/c-study-group-2024/.

Possible to follow as an edX course and obtain certificate
 - This course contains more material
 - May not be worth it unless you are early careere / changing direction
 - Financial assistance program is worth applying to, even if you may not usually be eligible for such programs
