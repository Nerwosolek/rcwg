## Discussion

### Cherry trees

- The `trees` data in R: Tim has tracked down the orginal source of the data, which correctly has diameter labelled as Diameter rather than Girth. 

    - Minimum proposal: add reference for original source in the help file

    - Bigger proposal: correct data and removing confusing references to Girth

    - Bigger propoasl will require changing help file, data file and examples. It will be a breaking change - affecting unknown number of CRAN packages. Decide it is is best to make minimum proposal, which should be uncontroversial and easy to fix.


- Edit the helpfile directly to create a patch: https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/blob/master/src/library/datasets/man/trees.Rd
    - This can be added as an attchment to a bug report on https://bugs.r-project.org 

- Trick for getting a patch for R from GitHub.

    - Make changes in a fork and commit it

    - Click on the commit id

    - Add '.diff' to the end of the URL 

    - Save the resulting file as a .diff text file
 
POST EDIT: The above trick only works for single commits. To get a diff for multiple commits, either:

 - Create a PR back to the r-svn mirror, then add '.diff' to the PR URL
 - Compare branches: from fork of repo, where it says "This branch is 2 commits ahead of ...", click on "2 commits ahead", then add '.diff' to the compare URL
