## Warm up 

Please tell us a bit about yourself, following the template below: 

Name: Heather Turner   
Country I am currently in: UK 
Something we could do or discuss together today: 

Name: Ella Kaye
Country I am currently in: UK  
Something we could do or discuss together today: How to build on the momentum from the Sprint? Follow-up events, both for R contribution and, possibly, social.

Name: Brian Terry  
Country I am currently in: UK  
Something we could do or discuss together today: No topics on my mind - just trying to get a sense for what's going on and if I can contribute in any way.
    
Name: Debartha Paul  
Country I am currently in: India  
Something we could do or discuss together: How about incorporating the test for deviance in GLM?(asymptotic)

Name: Gergely Daroczi  
Country: Hungary  
Topic: onboarding new languages/language teams to the translation workflow

## Discussion

### Translation

* Would be helpful to have team on GitHub R-devel organization for the translators (those with access to https://github.com/r-devel/translations, i.e. wiki and dashboard). Maybe also consider for R Development Guide team.
    - May want to add a translator as owner on GitHub R-devel organisation to help add new people
* How far to enforce translation workflow on new teams? (As documented at the R Project Sprint: https://github.com/r-devel/translations/wiki) 
    - Probably best to enforce for people using Weblate to contribute translations, so consistent for all translators and languages using platform. It is still possible to contribute translations using the traditional workflow if they prefer (as documented on https://developer.r-project.org/Translations30.html)
    - Test onboarding new language/team with Catalan!

### RCWG

Mailing list for R Contribution Working Group meeting notifications: https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-contribution-wg - there is a meeting tomorrow!

> (Thursday September 14): Contributor Office HoursEMEA/APAC, 09:00-10:00 UTC: https://www.meetup.com/r-contributors/events/295673493/
> AMER, 09:30-10:00 PDT: https://www.meetup.com/r-contributors/events/295680950/Join whichever suits, or both!

### Tests for deviance in GLM

- Could the print/summary for glm be extended to included a p-value for the test of residual deviance (vs the null model)?
    - This can be obtained with `anova()` on a single model. As the test is not always useful (specifically in the case of binary GLMs), it is unlikely this would be added to main print/summary. In general for this sort of question, would also consider what is done for other models, e.g. lm, nls. Such wishlist items can be proposed on Bugzilla, in which case you would want to include an example showing what output you would like to see and making a case for why the output should be updated.
- Could be good to have Slack channel to discuss potential wish list items as not obvious at the moment where to get feedback on ideas to see if a wishlist item is likely to get attention/support from R Core.

### Building on momentum from the Sprint

- Wouldn't want to do in exclusive way - should be open to people who did not attend the sprint
- Could promote Office Hours to sprint attendees as a way to keep involved.
- Tentative plan to run Bug BBQ/Developer Day alongside useR! 2024.
- Could sometimes have a longer session, with two or three bugs prepared to work on together?
    - Perhaps some people are working on bugs already and would be prepared to share work in progress?
    - Could include mentoring for people to organize next session, so not always same people facilitating.
    - Possibly alternate extended session between EMEA/APAC and AMER office hour times, to cover alternative time zones/not add too much to existing organization.
- Also scheduled times for people working on translations to get together? Perhaps suggest to others to help organize. Look again at what Bioconductor folk do - think they were doing something once a month.
- Social get-togethers?
    - Do we need some structure when run online? RainbowR have found "show and tell" to work well: people share what they are working on. May be more of an incentive to come than "just" a social chat.
    - Maybe once a quarter? Assuming some community built up over time through contributor hours etc, so people more motivated to come.
    
### Translations again

- Debartha was working on Bengali translations at the sprint. Can be difficult to know how to handle words that have direct translation but are more commonly know in English.
- Could R return English as well as non-English error message? May help search for help.
    - Search engines should be able to manage with non-English message too.
    - Can also change locale so that can re-run to get English message if required. Gergely can write up a POC helper function(s) that would make it easier to obtain English message and then we can decide where to put it (R Core vs pkg).
