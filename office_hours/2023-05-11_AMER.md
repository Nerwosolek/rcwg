## Discussion

### Bugzilla

Exploring R's Bugzilla: https://bugs.r-project.org
 - How to file a Bug report (see help in https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/BugTrack.html)
     - Requires an account: https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/BugTrack.html#RCorePkgBug
     - Fill in optional metadat if you can, leave if unsure
 - Browsing bugs and finding a good first issue
 - Example bug: https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18306
     - This is actually a feature request not a bug; should have been categorised as "wishlist" when reporting
     - Another contributor has given some existing code in base R that they think fulfills the requirements
     - We ran this code and agree it does the job!
     - Bug reporter thinks the behaviour (creating a coloured background behind a text label) should be part of `text()` rather than requiring separate use of `rect()`
     - Only R Core can change this item to a wishlist. It would only be added with R Core support.
     - A contributor could add a comment in support of the proposal or in support of closing the report. If a contributor is in support they could propose a patch.

### Proposing a patch

 - Need to find the function in the R sources
     - We found the `text()` function as an example: https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/blob/master/src/library/graphics/R/text.R.
     - It is actually as S3 generic function, which has methods for different types of objects. In this case there is only a default method defined, so potentially a patch would modify this function.
     - The function includes a call to some underlying C code, without digging deeper it is not clear if we would want to modify the R code or the C code.
  - This demo walks through how a simple patch might be created: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOlF8fPf9v8

### Weblate

Exploring Weblate: https://translate.rx.studio/projects/r-project  

 - Looked a how to add Spanish translations
      - Go to the Spanish language
      - Choose a component to work on
      - Click translate to see messages that need translating
 - Can use "Automatic suggestions" button to get machine translation by Microsoft Translate that you can clone and review
 - Can also be helpful to check how other languages have translated the message: even if you don't fully understand, you can see which parts have been kept as English, e.g. function names.
 - After adding/reviewing a translation must uncheck "Needs editing" otherwise translation is marked as "fuzzy" and will not be used! (The English message will still be used instead).
 - Contributed translations are gathered every few months and added to the development version of R.
 - Translations will appear in the next major release of R (next one will be April 2024!)
 - Draft documentation on Weblate:
    https://github.com/r-devel/rdevguide/pull/142/files#diff-475395d82ee88e462892d2ad3197e80fe249f6bda9b8efcb3ae7c5316f6a8cd8R201
    
### Keep informed of future R Contributor Office Hours

Keep informed about R Contributor events in one of following ways:
 - Join the Meetup: https://www.meetup.com/r-contributors
 - Use the Google Calendar/iCal links on https://contributor.r-project.org/events/ 
     - Outlook and other email programs can import the iCal `.ics` files so the events are added to your calendar and should be updated when new events are added.
