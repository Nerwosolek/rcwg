## Discussion

## R Contributors Slack (https://contributor.r-project.org/slack)

- Slack only shows 90 days of history. Could we have an archive? Yes, the admins can download the archive and we could put this in a private repo on GitHub for people to refer to. So this is a short-term solution. Longer solution may be to move to something like Matrix - this is open source and we'd have full control over archive - bring up at next R Contribution Working Group meeting.

## C book club

 - Earlier ran a book club based on Modern C: https://contributor.r-project.org/events/book-club/
 - Put a few options in #book-club-modern-c

    - Spread out material over longer period (13 fortnightly sessions rather than 8)

    - Do the C sessions of CS50, Harvard's Introduction to Compute Science (https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/). 1 session a month.

    - Has a lot of advantages in well-prepared material and GitHub Codespace. More flexible to keep up with.

    - Hanne found this good preparation for R Project Sprint

    - Wild card option: the R Dev Guide (https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/)

    - Hanne would have would this more helpful as preparation for sprint.

    - Could help develop dev guide itself

    Could be something of a cross between a book-group and a working group to improve the dev guide

    - Possibly add session and chapter on R's C API.


## Bug spreadsheet

- Annotated list of bugs: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bhfPIJQXeKpydigMH79FKIkdHO9NxlBSB_bTRoCFnPY/edit#gid=0

    - Would be good to go over some of these in a future R Contribution Office Hour
