## Discussion

### R dev container

Atharva worked on the R Dev Container (https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-env) for GSoC 2023.

Development slowed after the summer, as Atharva and his mentors (Heather and James Tripp) moved on to other things, but he is still able to work on some further developments.

We reviewed the open pull requests and merged them in.

We had a brief look at the issue regarding tools to support programming in C (https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-env/issues/32)
 - The current version of the dev container has most of the tools we think we need, can remove one tool that is probably unnecessary, then close this issue.
 
 Heather mentioned a few issues she had noticed through working with the container
 - Tracking changes via git within the container is not helpful as users will not be making commits back to the r-dev-env repository. So we can remove the .git file to take it out of version control.
 - Instead we should make use of the SVN version control tools - need to look again at how to get this working.
 - Need to updated to latest version of R.
 
Heather will work on adding/curating issues to help focus work in the next month or so.

Potential for a GSoC 2024 project even if we do some work in the meantime, also possibly a useR! 2024 talk.
