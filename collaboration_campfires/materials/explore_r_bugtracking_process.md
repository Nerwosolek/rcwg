## Activites in Breakout Rooms:

Timer for breakout rooms: https://cuckoo.team/collaboration-campfire-activities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Activity 1: Exploring R's Bugzilla (https://bugs.r-project.org/)
Time: 15 minutes

Bugzilla has some simple functionality to create tabular/graphical reports. Let's use these to explore R's bug database.

1. Go to reports and select Graphical Reports (or if you prefer, Tabular Reports - just ignore chart-specific instructions).
2. On the horizontal axis, select "Resolution". Go to the Resolution selection box, scroll to the end, press the Shift key as you click "MOVED", so that all resolutions are selected. Click the "Generate Report" button to create a bar chart. Review the different resolutions. How many bugs are open (have resolution "---")?
3. Start a new report. On the horizontal axis, select "Component", check the box to specify vertical labels, select only Resolution "---" and generate a bar chart. Discuss the result in your group - Which are the components with most/least open bugs? What do all the components mean? Which topics are the people in your group most interested in?
4. Start a new report. On the horizontal axis, select "Version", check the box to specify vertical labels, select only Resolution "---" and generate a bar chart. What is the oldest version of R in an open bug report? What year was this from?
5. Start a new report. On the vertical axis select "Status", on the horizontal axis select "Number of comments" and generate a Line Graph. Discuss in your group - what can you infer from this summary?

BONUS Q: Start a new report. On the horizontal axis, select "Assignee Real Name" and generate a bar chart. Who is the odd one out?! Clue: https://www.r-project.org/contributors.html.

Feedback from Activity 1 as participants return to the main room  
Time: 5 minutes  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Activity 2: Searching bugs on Bugzilla (https://bugs.r-project.org/)
Time: 10 minutes

Before reporting a bug, we should first check if it has already been reported. Suppose you want to report a bug related to using `rbind()` with data.frames.

1. Search "rbind data.frame" using the search box in the navigation bar of Bugzilla. How many bugs are returned?
2. Search "rbind data.frame" using the Simple Search function. How many bugs are returned? Can you work out why it is different from part 1?
3. Search "rbind data.frame" using the Advanced Search function. How many bugs are returned? Can you work out why it is different from part 2?

BONUS Q: can you get Advanced Search to return the same results as part 1?  

Feedback from Activity 2 as participants return to the main room    
Time: 5 minutes  

For more on bug-reporting, see https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/bug-tracking.html.  
TIP: You can also search the R-Devel mailing lists by Googling "{search terms} site:/stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/".  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Activity 3: Browsing bugs on Bugzilla (https://bugs.r-project.org/)  
Time: 10 minutes   

If we want to contribute by reviewing or fixing a bug, we need to find bugs that need attention and that we may be able to help with.

1. Select Browse from the menu and look at the topics in "R" product category. Select a topic your group is interested in/feels comfortable with.
2. Scroll to the bottom and use "Change Columns" to remove "Product" and "Resolution",  and add "Opened" and "Number of comments".
3. Order the bug reports by date, with the most recent at the top.
4. Pick a bug with 3-4 comments (one that has received some response). Discuss in your group - can you categorise it as one of the following:
    * Bug Reporter misunderstands the function/documentation.
    * Bug can not be reproduced.
    * Cause of bug is still being worked out.
    * Fix to bug is still being worked out/under debate.
    * A solution has been proposed by Bug Reporter or a Bug Reviewer and is waiting approval from R Core.
    * An R Core member has committed to implement the fix, but not yet done this.
    * Something else - please specify!
5. Pick a bug with 1-2 comments (one that has had little response). Discuss in your group - can you categorise it as one following, according to what action needs to be taken next?
    * Bug is actually a wish list item (suggested new feature) and should be recategorised/discussed.
    * Bug needs a (simpler) reproducible example.
    * Cause of bug not clear from report and needs investigation.
    * There is a proposed fix from the Bug Reporter that needs to be checked and reviewed.
    * Needs input on best way to fix from Bug Reviewer or R Core member.
    * How to fix is clear, but there is not yet a patch or commitment to fix.
    * Bug report has received a negative response (not a bug/not a welcome change) and should be closed.
    * Something else - please specify!

Feedback from Activity 3 as participants return to the main room 
Time: 5 minutes 

For more on bug review, see https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/reviewing-bugs.html 
For more on bug fixing, see https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/FixBug.html 

TIP: You can find bugs where R Core have asked for a code/documentation patch by using the Advanced Search to find bugs with the key word HELPWANTED. Here's a shortcut: https://bugs.r-project.org/buglist.cgi?bug_status=__open__&keywords=HELPWANTED&columnlist=bug_id%2Ccomponent%2Cbug_status%2Cshort_desc%2Cchangeddate%2Clongdescs.count
