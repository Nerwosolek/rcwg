## Agenda:

1. Welcome the Community Champions
2. Saranjeet & Heather give a brief overview
    - Informing community champions about the existence of upcoming collaboration campfires.
        - Outreach building on [R Development Guide](https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/)
        - A [Digital Infrastructure Incubator](https://incubator.codeforscience.org/cohort) project, Code for Science & Society
        - Collaboration campfires will run on the 4 Tuesday of the month, February - May, 15:30-17:00 UTC. Will end 4 weeks before the useR! conference where we plan to have a [Bug Barbecue](https://github.com/r-devel/rcontribution/issues/18) event.
    - Share [initial overview of the program](overview.md), what we plan to do at the sessions.
3. Open feedback discussion
    - Some intial prompts (did not go through these systematically in the meeting - see later points!)
        - Will people in your community be ready for the content we have in mind? (are we pitching at the right level?)
        - Are we aiming to do too little? Too much?
        - Input on content? Bugs? Translations? Priorities.
        - Good icebreaker activities?
        - Good activities to include?
    - Who are we looking to attract? Are the people that will come the people we want? Need to target the right audience.
        - Main audience:
            - A diverse group (want to attract people from currently under-represented groups)
                - an opportunity to connect people from the MENA region, Latin America, Africa, with international R community
            - Experience: new to contributing, but intermediate R programmers (or beyond - can write a function at least).
            - Trajectory: the events will be like a taster session, for people curious about contributing. Hopefully, a reasonable proportion will stay part of the contributor community: join our Slack, follow us on Twitter, join one-off events like the bug barbecue. Ideally, a few will join a translation team or the community of people triaging bugs on a semi-regular basis (people can adjust their contribution to the time they have). Some might apply for the one or two outreachy internships that we hope to have available this year. One or two might go one to become "serious" contributors - making regular contributions over the longer term.
            - Background: possibly computer science/statistics students/ECRs vs people focused on applications of R; bootcamp graduates. May have understanding from other programming languages
            - Motivation: what's in it for them?
                - Raise visibility within international R community
                - Improve R programmings skills
                - General experience of contributing to open source project (something to mention on CV/in interviews)
                - Learning from more experienced programmers
                - Part of community learning and working together
                - Giving back to a project they rely on
        - Also looking to build a small group who can continue to pass information on in events like these or by contributing to maintaining the R Development Guide/other R Contribution Working Group initiatives. Establish a format (Collaboration Campfire) that can be reused in future - either with the same content, or focusing on different aspects of contribution.
    - Who's contributing to R development already? 
        - Mostly statistical/computer science researchers, many that made early substantial contributions to codebase. 
        - Could do a survey to find it out.
        - But we want to increase diversity - by targeting people similar tp existing contributors we may miss good people!
        - New career paths emerging where people may be able to incoporate it into their work: research software engineers
    - Specific feedback on plans:
        - Reduce time spent on the history (lesser than 20 minutes). Participants are not so interested in our motivation but what's in it for them!
        - Think prospectively rather than retrospectively (outline vision for what participants might go on to after campfires)
        - Add a section who the R dev guide is for [Editor: is this in Dev Guide itself?]
    - Theory of change: ![](https://i.imgur.com/Jb69K0C.png)
        - Helpful to consider in growing community, capacity building.

4. Strategizing together on the best way to reach people in their communities? (how often to contact people/do outreach? Sign up to a mailing list? Sign up to sequence of sessions? Just one session)
    - Did not cover this agenda item in the meeting, beyond general discussion of target audience. Post-meeting feedback welcome!
    
5. Suggest others/early career researchers (name at least one) to recruit into the sessions -- not necessarily early career researchers
    - Did not cover this agenda item in the meeting, beyond general discussion of target audience. Post-meeting feedback welcome!

6. Any more ideas and/or Feedback.
    * Please use: the Written Feedback HackMD for post-meeting feedback (link shared with invited community champions)
        * Further thoughs on discussion above
        * Comments on our [Plan for the Collaboration Campfires](overview.md)
        * Other post-meeting thoughts!  
      
      Feedback will be incorporated into the plan or added as TODOs in the GitHub issue ([#11](/issues/11)).

7. Actions for Saranjeet and Heather:
    - Check who came to the useR! tutorials, for people to invite/give feedback. Double-check folk that came to follow-up meeting [Heather]
    - Also people who have shown interest on the R-Devel Slack. [Heather]
    - Add meeting minutes and draft plan to https://github.com/r-devel/rcontribution/collaboration_campfires [Saranjeet]
