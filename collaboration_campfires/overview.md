# Goals for the Campfires

* Activate/introduce the R Development guide
* Build some community around it
    - Specifically: usher participants into the useR! conference with a little bit more knowledge + community, prepare participants for participation in Bug Barbecue ([#11](https://github.com/r-devel/rcontribution/issues/11))
* 90 minute sessions, every 4th Tuesday of the month 16:00 - 17:00UTC


# Goals for the First Two Sessions:

* Familiarity with [Bug-tracking](https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/bug-tracking.html) and [Reviewing Bugs](https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/reviewing-bugs.html) sections of the R Development guide
* Illustrate a few of the different ways that people contribute to bug tracking
 * Practice some of the ways that people participate and contribute

## February - Introduction to the topic: Bugzilla
	
### Content: 

Reviews sections of the Dev guide where the topic is discussed; discussion format, discussing that part of the guide, walk through the guide - introduction to the whole guide; submit request for a Bugzilla account
	
### Goals: 

* Giving an idea of whatâ€™s in the guide at the moment
* Empower users to use Bugzilla
* Familiarity with Bugzilla, bug tracker for R, and its various sections
* Learn/know how to find a bug that needs attention

### Format:

* {15-20 minutes} introduction to Bugzilla + discussing various functionalities of Bugzilla,
* {50 minutes} small tasks -- find 10 latest bugs from your topic of interest, count of people who have fixed bugs in your topic of interest for the last one year/ 6 months, mapping the activities on Bugzilla for the past year [we could orient this part as 'mapping Bugzilla for the year 2021'], if time permits then we could do explore the state of Bugzilla at the start of the R project, confirm the bug on your machine
* {10 minutes} participant verbal feedback, invite for next collaboration cafe, thank you for attending

Exercise: submit request for a Bugzilla account?

Q for champions call: how do we make this session interactive? Expecting a very green audience

## March - Exercises: Bugzilla
	
### Content: 

Short exercises that people can carry out in groups. We give a question and participants need to find how many bugs have been addressed and how many remain. (Advertise about having a bugzilla account (not compulsory though))

### Goals: 

* We will be able to see how the guide is working in practice as participants will have to use the guide to answer prompts
* Participants will start getting familiar with/used to bugzilla which they might not do on their own
* Practice of handling a bug - a debugging exercise? Identifying a bug on their computer? Being able to confirm? debug?

Q for champions call: Any other ideas about how to conduct these exercises?
